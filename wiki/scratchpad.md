## About
This is a periodically-updated scratchpad for the primary developer. It's not automatically updated, it's just here to give a share vague concepts that have been considered.

# Disclaimer
**This is not a list of features to implement**, it exists to keep track of ideas to _research_. If anything listed below sounds like something that should get more attention, please make a feature request on the [Issues page](https://github.com/Frolic-chat/Frolic/issues)

## Scratchpad
```text
AUTOBUILD/CI

*** update electron

Confront auto-ads
	investigate timer - is it broken?

StrangeStorage:
	Send Love function (üëç/üëé)

	Pronouns/perception for H/S?
	HQ portrait
	Safe Word feature from april 1 post
		Enabled/Disabled state for each player
	Protocol exchange
		When someone starts typing at you you get a message, can we send something innocuous back to figure out if we should start protocol communication? Is there any other non-intrusive player-to-player communication to piggyback off of?
	Investigate storage options:
		EIcon???
		Inline image data (steganography)
		Profile image data (steganography or caption?)
		Contact info?
			rule: Only use completely irrelevant/dead
			AIM: aim:goim?screenname=<DATA>
			skype: skype:<DATA>?chat
			yahoo: ymsgr:sendIM?<DATA>
		groups
		channels
		can any of these be established from in chat?
