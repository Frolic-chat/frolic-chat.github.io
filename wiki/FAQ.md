# FAQ

## How can I report an issue with Frolic or make a feature request?
On the [issue tracker!](https://github.com/Frolic-chat/Frolic/issues)

## What features does Frolic offer over the old F-Chat Rising client?
We have a full changelog [available here!](development/CHANGELOG.html)
For a brief overview:
* More options to be notified when your friends/bookmarks are active
* The adblocker for the image preview actually works now
* The broken youtube proxy is removed, although the replacement doesn't currently play sound
* Removal of the old maintainer's AI chatbot
* Kemonomimi species identification
* Support for more anthro species
* Speciesless profiles are no longer considered human by default
* Bugfixes & backend touch-ups
* The developer is active :)

## Are there any big features I can look forward to in Frolic's future?
Sure, I have a lot of things I'd like to get done.
* Match-making display improvements to better portray how you overlap with other players.
* Better notification settings, including a timed "quiet mode" profile.
* In-app note-writing, including draft-saving and resuming, and integration with the chat window.

## How can I help improve Frolic?
There are two ways to help out:
* Submit an idea to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Frolic-chat/Frolic/issues). Include how ever many or few details as you want. Ideas that fit the general theme of "enhanced chat client" will get attention. Ideas that are simple and unobtrusive will also get attention. And if you include an offer to do the bulk of the code-work yourself, it's _even more likely_ to get attention. :)
   Alternatively, discussing the way you use Frolic can give the developers hints on where to focus their efforts.
* **Alternatively:** Fork the project, make some commits, and submit a pull request with an explanation of what your changes accomplish. Simple bug fixes, logic improvements and code improvements are mostly likely to be accepted quickly. If your code is in line with project goals, it will be merged into a new branch for further development.

## What happened to F-Chat Rising?
No one knows. What we do know is that the maintainer was absent from the Rising repository for over 6 months prior to it unexpectedly going offline. Additionally, the f-list profile of the maintainer's bot was updated sometime around February 8, 2025, and was subsequently blocked from viewing due to a "shocking and harmful content violation". As of May 29, the owner has not edited the profile to lift the block. Speculating on what's going on with real people is rude and unprofessional, so we won't go any further than the facts.

## Any relation to the Horizon client?
Both Frolic and Horizon are derivatives of the same defunct F-Chat Rising client, which itself is developed from the official F-Chat desktop client. Horizon was forked from an early version of Frolic, as we were the only up-to-date F-Chat Rising fork anyone could find at the time. Both projects are available under the Expat License (commonly called the "MIT License").

The lead developer of Frolic regularly participates in discussion and code review on Horizon and submits code improvements where appropriate. Meanwhile, Frolic also pulls relevant improvements from Horizon to keep our client up-to-date.

There is no hostility between these projects; We're happy Horizon exists, and we're sure they're thankful for our contributions.

### What makes Frolic different from Horizon?
It's likely that Frolic and Horizon will maintain feature parity for an extended period of time. If you need a concise way to think about it, consider them sister projects - similar but distinct.

* In terms of end-user experience, there may never be much difference! Frolic seeks to establish a more well-refined set of options, cleanly organized and explained for maximum usability even if you aren't a power-user. Meanwhile, Horizon's lead developer has expressed interest in having more options for a high amount of customization.

  * Currently, both projects are keen to squash bugs to establish a cleaner foundation to work on, so many changes established in one end up in the other.
