# Changelog

### Next?
* Enhanced matching
* In-app note RP

## Release 0.7.7
* Reduced memory usage
* Eicon selector overhaul. Searching is much faster. Almost *too* fast...
  There have been a few UI tweaks, but nothing major.

* Significant updates to many backend components
* Adblocker for image preview and dictionary updated

## Release 0.7.6
* Keep track of your public-room RPs better - There's a new option to match usernames with your highlight words. You can find the checkbox to enable name-highlights in each tab's settings.
  * There is no global setting; this is a temporary (but fully working) solution until a larger notification revision can be made.
* The character tooltip/preview has been cleaned up.
  * On bi characters, it now shows their gender-preference, if they have one.
* Bugfix: After being bugged for literally forever, you can now view your logs from the login window, without having to log in first.
* Bugfix: The "Furs and/or Humans" preference is only used for matchmaking if species matching is indeterminate. This effectively combines them into a single score, using the most well-defined factor available.
  * Previously, a character's species could be effectively counted twice - once against Furry Preference and once against species kinks.
* Bugfix: Orientation is only used for matchmaking if gender kink matching is indeterminate.
  * Previously, a character's gender could play an overly-significant role in matchmaking.
* With the above changes, the display of matchmaking no longer shows "likes [gender/species]" multiple times.
* A short notice has been added to the smart filters settings to help you better understand the limitations of filtering.
* Bugfix: The eicon selector no longer leaks memory from over-use.
* Bugfix: The primary text box should be the correct size more frequently. This should resolve strange resizing and a scrollbar when there were no lines to scroll.
* Bugfix: On linux, the minimize button was un-minimizing the window. We've given it a stern talking-to and this should no longer be an issue.
* Bugfix: On a similar note, the chat should properly adjust to the new space when maximizing and unmaximizing the window.
* Some other mild annoyances have been fixed.

## Release 0.7.5
* Bugfix: Conflict resolution between F-Chat Rising and Frolic. No longer should they battle for control of your pinned taskbar icon.
  * **Please uninstall prior versions of Frolic and F-Chat Rising before installing this version.**
* Automatic update check
  * There is no automatic download, just a menu entry to download it for yourself. Configuration options will come once it proves to be working well.
* First stage of new desktop icons - you can enjoy them while the app is running!
* Bugfix: You can no longer save a blank memo.
  * Additionally, you can delete an accidentally blank memo by re-opening and saving it.
* Better alignment on some sidebar icons
* Lots of backend refactoring and simplification.
* Password saving got a makeover to bring the codepaths up-to-date with modern coding standards.

## Release 0.7.4
* Bugfix: Resolved missing match summary after a search due to event emitter accidentally removing username event
* Bugfix: Resolved search ticker continuing to tick after all results were resolved, reducing responsiveness
* Bugfix: Core properly stops when you call `stop()`
* Begin the move to better debug logging
* Update to electron 22
* Bugfix: Minor editor warnings resolved
* Minor formatting changes

## Release 0.7.3
* Post-length matching was very broad in past versions, making it less-than-useful. It has been reigned in, and you can expect the following:
  * No Color/Unused if either you or they have No Preference or have their desired post-length unset.
  * Bright Green if they desire identical post-length as you desire.
  * Dim Green if their desired post-length is one-off yours.
  * Yellow if their's is two-off yours.
  * Red for everything else.

  There is an option to broaden your results again if you had no issue with prior post-length matches.
* In past versions, some errors would freeze the login screen forever. There are now explanatory error messages for the most typical cases. If you encounter a situation where you can't log in but no error message is presented to you, please file a bug report.
  * Additionally, there are warning messages at the log-in screen for situations that may indicate feature degradation - specifically, if you can't contact the Xariah eicon service. Additional warnings will be added as they come up.
* Bugfix: The 'Recon' tab in someone's profile accidentally showed duplicate entries. This is no longer the case. Some minor performance improvements have resulted from the change that fixed this.
  * Some back-end component updates were required to make all this possible.
* Minor clean-ups to the arrangement of the left sidebar in preparation for future changes. No features have been removed. Additional improvements were made for users using very large or very small font sizes.
* Bugfix: Prevent overwriting your local eicon cache with nothing when you can't connect to the eicon server. Saves downloading 20MB, infrequently.
* Bugfix: Gay TG characters will no longer match each other automatically.
* Bugfix: An invalid list of fonts was fixed. If you notice a shift in font choice, this is why; it was always supposed to be this way.

## Release 0.7.2
* Bugfix: Don't play broadcast noise for every open tab!!!!! I'm serious!!!!!!!!!!
* Broadcasts are only logged in the console.
* Broadcasts won't play in private messages. Added an option to enable that if you want it.
* Profile Helper now checks for inappropriate color tags, including the incorrect gray/grey... uh, which one was it?
* The "open conversation" dialog will now hijack your text input so you can start typing into it immediately.
* Additionally, you can use the Enter key to submit your query instead of having to hit the button.
* Internal debug tool set to speed up testing
* Default EIcon adjustments
* Species refinements and "divinitys" plural fix.
* Bugfix: Profile helper only recommended adding more images to characters with exactly 2 images. Now it also recommends it to characters who have only a single image as well.
* Speed-ups to URL handling and other under-the-hood fixes

## Release 0.7.0
* Orientation matching improvements for nonbinary genders, with further experimental improvements locked behind a toggle in the options
* Updated the room member list sorting button so people realize they can sort the room member list
* Member list gender sorting now uses your character orientation to put your prefered genders on top, instead of using a predefined order
* Updated the eicon pages to remove dead icons and include a wider variety of icons
* Significant updates to species lists, including adding "exotic species"
* Moved documentation to [its own site](https://frolic-chat.github.io/)
* Improvements to notifications for friend logins.
* Large localization update.

## Release 0.6.0
* Added setting to receive notifications when friends/bookmarks log in
* Added setting to receive notifications when friends/bookmarks send a message in a channel (configurable per-channel!)
* Notification settings with similar purpose have been grouped together. Further adjustments are still needed to the overall settings layout.
* The adblocker for the image popup works now!
* The channel member list and friends list no longer wig out when moving between PMs and channels
* Broken YouTube proxy removed; videos will play in the popup now, but they play muted ðŸ˜’
* Alternative themes had their colors updated
* Fixed a bug where notechecker would still check for notes even if it was disabled
* Touch-ups to Kemonomimi matching
* Quieted some spammy application logs
* Updates to backend components
* Moved some fixed strings into the localization database.

Thank you to [FatCatClient](https://github.com/FatCatClient) for their contributions to keeping F-Chat up to date with modern features.


## Release 0.5.0
* Kemonomimi now match much more favorably in many circumstances. See the [Pull Request](https://github.com/Frolic-chat/Frolic/pull/3) for details.
* Adjustments to species categories in preparation for hybrid-species matching improvements
* Fixed a rare log-deletion oversight from vanilla F-Chat.
* Empty species are no longer considered human by default; they need some kind of decisive indicator such as "Humans Only" partner preference.
* Build fixes in preparation for Electron update
