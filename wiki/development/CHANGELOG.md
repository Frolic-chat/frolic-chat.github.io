## Release 0.7.2
* Bugfix: Don't play broadcast noise for every open tab!!!!! I'm serious!!!!!!!!!!

* Internal debug tool set to speed up testing
* Default EIcon adjustments

* Adjustments to species categories in preparation for hybrid-species matching improvements
* Fixed a rare log-deletion oversight from vanilla F-Chat.
