# How to Frustrate Yourself & Your Computer
A computer cannot provide judgment accurate to human standards. It's important to understand this limitation when thinking about how the Rising-based match-maker works.

## Computer Matching
1. **Computers can only process information they're given**

   Having an empty profile or leaving fields blank will lead to worse matching results.

   Having only a handful of kinks and fields filled in may get you matches, but they'll be highly inaccurate.

2. Computer understanding must be pre-programmed.

   It's not possible for a program to _understand_ everything. Therefore, in the case of fields like species and age descriptions, using typical language and phrasing will get you the best results.

   Entering non-number ages is a good way to break age-matching.

   Entering a phrase or sentence in your species is a good way to break species-matching.

   Using highly-custom phrasing, such as unicode characters or unique spelling, will prevent Frolic from being able to use that information to help find your partners.

   Accounting for every spelling error is an impossibility, and will frustrate the match-maker, so spellcheck your species and other fields.

## Human Matching
**A human being is still going to make the final judgment.**

   When all is said and done, your potential roleplay partner is going to look at your profile and make their decision.

   Even if it doesn't help the match-maker, having inline images and a readable layout will play a role in netting you more partners.

   Custom kinks are not used by the match-maker, but are an easy to way to entice any person who reaches your profile.

   Additionally, partners who find you may be frustrated if your profile lacks detail and opt to pass you by, even if the match-maker said you would be good matches.
