# Character Matching
A computer cannot provide judgment accurate to human standards. It's important to understand this limitation when thinking about how the Rising-based match-maker works.

This page describes some details about how to return positive results using the character matching.

## How to match with other characters.
1. Frolic can only use the information you give it. The more information you have in your profile (**non-custom** kinks in particular), the better the matching quality will be. The algorithm considers the following data points:
   *   Age
   *   Gender
   *   Sexual preference
   *   Dominance preference
   *   Human/anthro preference
   *   Post length preference
   *   Position preference
   *   Non-custom kinks
   *   Species
1. Matching for non-binary genders relies on kinks. For example, if your non-binary character has a preference for females, make sure 'females' are listed as a favorite kink.
   *    Similarly if you want to match with non-binary genders -- independent of your characters' gender -- add your preferred non-binary types into your kink list.
   <small>This is not the most ideal way to match gender preferences, and alternative methods are being considered.</small>
3. Use the 'underage characters' kink is used to filter underage characters.
4. 'Older characters' and 'younger characters' kinks are interpreted as age difference of 20% of your character's age or greater. So a 20 year old with an age difference kink will match 4+ years. A 50 year old will match "younger characters" 40 and below and "older characters" 60 and above.
5. If you have a species-fluid character (e.g. you play both your character as both a human and an anthro), you can indicate this by setting your **species** in your character profile in the following ways. Frolic will then score you against the best fitting type.
    * Human or tiger
    * Human, tiger, or dragon
    * Anthro (Horse or Tiger)
    * Dragon (Dwarf, Elf, or Human)
    * Elf (optionally vampire or dwarf)
    * Feline (optionally horse, tiger, or elf)
