# Character Matching
_A computer cannot provide judgment accurate to human standards. It's important to understand this limitation when thinking about how the Rising-based match-maker works._

This page describes some details about how to return positive results using the character matching.

## How to match with other characters
1. Frolic can only use the information you give it. The more information you have in your profile (**non-custom** kinks in particular), the better the matching quality will be. The algorithm considers the following data points:
   *   Age
   *   Gender
   *   Sexual preference
   *   Dominance preference
   *   Human/anthro preference
   *   Post length preference
   *   Position preference
   *   Non-custom kinks
   *   Species

2. Matching for non-binary genders relies primarily on kinks. Where ever it appears obvious, an orientation match is made, but not all orientations can be cleanly applied to the whole gender spectrum. See the [details page](orientation.html) for, well, details.

3. Use the 'underage characters' kink to filter underage characters.

4. 'Older characters' and 'younger characters' kinks are interpreted as age difference of 20% of your character's age or greater. So a 20 year old with an age difference kink will match 4+ years. A 50 year old will match "younger characters" 40 and below and "older characters" 60 and above.

5. Frolic will only score you as a single species, even if you play a species-fluid character. Work to improve hybrid matching is ongoing. If species matching is important to you, use a highly typical phrase for your species.

   If you have a species-fluid character and list multiple species in the field, Frolic will attempt to find the best match (usually the most detailed or longest).

   If you set an animal species but your body type is human, you may be accidentally picked up as a kemonomimi (catgirl). To avoid this, don't set your body type on a character that can vary between human/anthro.

   The [species matching details](species-matching.html) page has in-depth information on species matching.
