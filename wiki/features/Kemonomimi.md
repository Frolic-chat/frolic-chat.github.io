# 0.5.0 The Great Catgirl Remix
This update adds the necessary architecture to support kemonomimi in Furry Pairing matching.

<small>A _kemonomimi_ is a humanoid character with animal ears, and possibly a tail or other obvious animal feature (like a shell for a turtle-person). The matchmaker figures out if your character is a kemonomimi by looking for an obvious kemonomimi species in your "species" field or by checking that you have an animal species and a "human" body type. If your furry character is incorrectly being detected as a kemonomimi instead of an anthro, change your body type to "anthro".</small>

Catgirls are frequently considered human-ish by furries and furry by humans. An issue arises when trying to detect a character's "Furry preference" - which only lets you select humans or furries (or both) as a prefered partner. Frolic tries to combat this in two ways.

First, add a check to the preference paradigm to account for a character's kemonomimi kink, if they have it. But if they don't, move on to method number two: Let the catgirl herself decide if she wants to be interpreted as human or furry in regards to the furry preference.

By default, kemonomimi will be considered furry. However, by choosing certain options on their profile, the character matcher will be able to gleen the intent of the character - is your character a furry that's slightly _less_ furry, or a human that just happens to have some animal attributes?

A kemonomimi can set their perception preference in one of the following ways:
1. Set Partner Preference to "Only humans" or "Prefer humans, furries ok".
2. Add Humans in your Favorite or Yes kinks, and leave Anthros out of either of them.
3. Add Anthros in your Maybe or No kinks, and leave Humans out of either of them.

In many cases where a definitive conclusion can't be reached, a pairing preference simply won't appear as part of the matching criteria. This is done to give favor to other factors with definitive results â€” such as your kink overlap and post length preference, rp duration preference, etc.

**Remember:** It is not possible for an automated machine to make decisions for you, but hopefully this change will make your partner selection easier by showing you potential partners with caveats.

<small>While it would certainly be better to just have a checkbox, the chat client cannot send arbitrary data across the F-List network, therefore there'd be no way for other chatters to detect what you've set. Therefore, some manner of transferable information needs to be used. This is the best we have for now, but if you think you found a better way, open an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Frolic-chat/Frolic/issues).</small>
