# New Features
These are major features, for all changes, see the [changelog](../development/CHANGELOG.md)

## Interaction
### Desktop notifications
Receive desktop notifications when friends or bookmarks log in.

Receive desktop notifications when friends or bookmarks send a message in a channel (with per-channel customization).

### Broadcasts
Broadcasts no longer clog up all your PMs and logs, and they don't play a sound for every PM they show in. (F-Chat owes me new headphones.)

### Eicons
New eicon category for cute critters.

## Character Matching
### Kemonomimi - Furry or Human?
Normally Kemonomimi are perceived as animal+human, so the "Furry and/or Human" pairing considers them furry. Kemonomimi who want to be perceived as human instead of furry when looking at a partner's "Furry preference" can set up one of these situations on their profile:

* Set your Furry preference to "Humans only" or "Humans preferred"
* Put humans in your yes/fave kinks and leave anthro out of your yes/fave kinks
* Put anthro in your maybe/no kinks and leave humans out of your maybe/no kinks

Any one of the above will let you match favorably to someone with a "human only" or "human preferred" pairing preference.

### Room Sorting by Gender
Did you know you could sort the room list? And now, when you sort by gender, it uses your character's gender preferences (orientation & kinks) to determine the order, so your preferred genders are first!

## Misc.
Legible error messages for errors that would prevent you from logging in.

The adblocker actually works!

The profile helper now helps you identify improper color code tags.

### Localization
More strings have been moved into the localization database for easier translation, should anyone want to help with that.
