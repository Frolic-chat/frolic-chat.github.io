# New Features
These are major features, for all changes, see the [changelog](wiki/CHANGELOG.md)

### Interaction
* Receive desktop notifications when friends or bookmarks log in.
* Receive desktop notifications when friends or bookmarks send a message in a channel (with per-channel customization).

### Character Matching
Normally Kemonomimi are perceived as animal+human, so the "Furry and/or Human" pairing considers them furry. Kemonomimi who want to be perceived as human instead of furry when looking at a partner's "Furry preference" can set up one of these situations on their profile:
    * Set your Furry preference to "Humans only" or "Humans preffered"
    * Put humans in your yes/fave kinks and leave anthro out of your yes/fave kinks
    * Put anthro in your maybe/no kinks and leave humans out of your maybe/no kinks
    Any one of these will let you match favorably to someone with a "human only" or "human preferred" pairing preference.

### Localization
More strings have been moved into the localization database for easier translation.
