# ðŸŒº Come Frolic!

**Frolic** is an extended version of the now-defunct F-Chat Rising which itself was an extended version of the [original F-Chat 3.0 client](https://wiki.f-list.net/F-Chat_3.0). Frolic's primary goal is to fine-tune the existing feature set of F-Chat Rising while keeping up with bug fixes and tidying up minor annoyances.


You'll connect with the same F-List, same players, and same channels you're already used to. You'll just do it with style!

Scroll down to see a [feature summary](#features), or take a look at a more [detailed list of features](https://github.com/Frolic-chat/Frolic/blob/master/README.md#key-differences)..


## Downloads
<small>While Frolic doesn't mess with your logs, it's always wise to backup important files before installing or upgrading software. Your logs from the vanilla F-Chat desktop client and from F-Chat Rising are located at `%appdata%\fchat\data` on Windows and in `~/.config/fchat/data` on Linux. Frolic continues to use this location so you can continue your conversations right where you left off.</small>

The latest release is **{{ site.latest_release }}**. Downloads are found [on the Releases page](https://github.com/Frolic-chat/Frolic/releases). See each releases' new features on its release page, or [view the full Changelog](https://github.com/Frolic-chat/Frolic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to see all improvements.

Refer to the [original installation instructions](https://wiki.f-list.net/F-Chat_3.0/Installation)
